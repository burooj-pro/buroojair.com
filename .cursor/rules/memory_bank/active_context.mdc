# Active Context: Current Operations

## Current Focus

**Last Updated:** Code Quality Improvements Complete  
**Status:** Production Ready - Maintenance Phase

## Recent Activities

### Completed
- ✅ Comprehensive project description created in `.cursor/rules/project_description.mdc`
- ✅ Memory Bank structure fully initialized
- ✅ All core Memory Bank files created and maintained
- ✅ Code quality improvements:
  - ✅ Removed console.log statements
  - ✅ Fixed video path typo
  - ✅ Added prop validation to all components
  - ✅ Improved error handling
  - ✅ Fixed Bootstrap class usage (replaced with Tailwind)
- ✅ Performance optimizations:
  - ✅ Added lazy loading to images
  - ✅ Optimized video loading
  - ✅ Improved asset loading strategy
- ✅ Accessibility improvements:
  - ✅ Added proper alt text to all images
  - ✅ Added aria-labels where needed
  - ✅ Improved semantic HTML
- ✅ Responsive design fixes:
  - ✅ Fixed Bootstrap classes to Tailwind
  - ✅ Improved mobile compatibility

### In Progress
- None currently

## Current Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Memory Bank initialization complete
2. ✅ Code quality review and improvements complete
3. ✅ Performance optimizations implemented
4. Monitor production performance
5. Continue maintenance and enhancements as needed

### Pending Questions
- None at this time

## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **Framework**: Nuxt.js 2.15.8 maintained (no migration to Nuxt 3)
- **Rendering**: Static site generation with client-side rendering (SSR disabled)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.3 with custom SCSS
- **Internationalization**: Vue I18n with English primary, Arabic prepared

### Architectural Decisions
- **Component Structure**: Modular section-based components in `/components/Sections/`
- **Asset Organization**: Static assets in `/static/`, compiled assets in `/assets/`
- **Build Strategy**: Static generation for optimal performance

## Recent Findings

### Code Quality Observations
- Project uses modern Vue.js 2 patterns
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Component-based architecture
- Good separation of concerns with section components

### Areas for Potential Improvement
- ✅ Form responsiveness in Hero section (addressed)
- ✅ Code organization and maintainability (improved)
- ✅ Performance optimizations (implemented)
- ✅ Documentation completeness (Memory Bank created)
- Future: Consider additional accessibility audits
- Future: Monitor and optimize Core Web Vitals

## Critical Considerations

### For Next Development Session
1. **Memory Bank**: All core files now created - must be read at start of each session
2. **Code Quality**: Review entire project structure for improvements
3. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize static asset loading
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work across device sizes

### Known Issues
- ✅ Form responsiveness in Hero section was identified and addressed
- ✅ Mobile compatibility improved (Bootstrap classes replaced with Tailwind)
- All sections verified for responsive design
- No critical issues currently known

## Temporary State

### Current Session Context
- Memory Bank initialization in progress
- Comprehensive project documentation being created
- Codebase analysis completed

### Working Memory
- Project is a Nuxt.js 2 static site for Burooj Air
- All major features are implemented and functional
- Focus is on code quality, performance, and maintainability improvements

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. Always read all Memory Bank files at session start
2. Check `active_context.mdc` first for current focus
3. Review `progress.mdc` for completed and pending tasks
4. Consult `system_patterns.mdc` for architectural guidance
5. Reference `tech_context.mdc` for technical specifications
